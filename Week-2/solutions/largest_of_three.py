# Solution: Largest of Three Numbers (Week 2, Programming Problem 2)

a = float(input("Enter first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter second number: "))
c = float(input("Enter third number: "))

if a >= b and a >= c:
    print(f"Largest number is {a}")
elif b >= a and b >= c:
    print(f"Largest number is {b}")
else:
    print(f"Largest number is {c}")
