# The Joy of Computing using Python
## Unit 15 - Week 12: Assignment 12

### Understanding PageRank Through Code-Based Simulation

In the lectures, we discussed a Python program that simulates a simplified version of the PageRank algorithm using point distribution. The program creates a directed graph, assigns points to nodes, redistributes those points according to outgoing edges, and compares the results with NetworkX's built-in PageRank function.

#### 1. Graph Creation
A directed graph (DiGraph) with 10 nodes (numbered 0 to 9) is created using NetworkX.

#### 2. Random Edge Generation
The function responsible for adding edges loops over all pairs of distinct nodes (s, t) and adds a directed edge from s to t with a 50% probability. Self-loops are avoided by checking that $s != t$.

#### 3. Initial Point Assignment
Every node starts with 100 points. These points are stored in a list where the index corresponds to the node number.

#### 4. Point Distribution Logic
During redistribution:
* If a node has no outgoing edges, it keeps all its points.
* If a node has outgoing edges, its points are split equally among them.

#### 5. Iterative Redistribution
The program repeatedly redistributes points over multiple rounds. After each round, the new distribution is printed. The user can stop the process by typing #.

#### 6. Graph Visualization
The graph structure, including nodes and edges, is displayed using matplotlib.

#### 7. Ranking Nodes by Points
At the end, a ranking function stores final points in a dictionary (node: points) and sorts them in ascending order to find which nodes have the lowest and highest scores.

#### 8. Comparison with PageRank
The program also calls NetworkX's built-in `pagerank()` function to compute the official PageRank values for the same graph and prints them for comparison with the manual simulation.

This simulation helps visualize how importance flows through a network and how PageRank emerges as a stable distribution of scores when point redistribution is repeated many times.

### Quiz Questions

**1) Why is a directed graph mandatory for implementing PageRank in the given code?**
- Because PageRank depends on the direction of influence between nodes
- Because undirected graphs cannot be read from files
- Because NetworkX only supports directed graphs
- Because visualization requires arrows
**Answer:** Because PageRank depends on the direction of influence between nodes

**2) Why are all nodes initially assigned equal points before distribution begins?**
- To speed up execution
- To remove any initial bias in importance
- To match NetworkX's internal implementation
- To simplify graph drawing
**Answer:** To remove any initial bias in importance

**3) If a node has many outgoing edges, how does it affect its contribution?**
- It gains more points
- It distributes more total points
- Its influence is divided among its neighbors
- It stops participating after one iteration
**Answer:** Its influence is divided among its neighbors

**Answer:** To help visualize a single iteration clearly

**5) Why is the PageRank process iterative?**
- Because sorting requires multiple passes
- Because convergence happens gradually
- Because graph size keeps changing
- Because visualization depends on iteration count
**Answer:** Because convergence happens gradually

**6) What is the main purpose of converting the points list into a dictionary?**
- To improve numerical accuracy
- To reduce memory usage
- To speed up sorting

**8) Why is sorting performed after computing final point values?**
- To normalize the graph
- To rank nodes by importance
- To check convergence
- To reduce floating-point error
**Answer:** To rank nodes by importance

**9) What happens if the user stops the iteration process too early?**
- Results remain accurate
- Values become random
- Convergence still occurs
- Rankings may be misleading
**Answer:** Rankings may be misleading

- Use of sorting
- Deterministic initialization
- Mathematical convergence
- Absence of cycles
**Answer:** Mathematical convergence

**12) Which factor most strongly increases a node's PageRank score?**
- Number of outgoing edges
- Random initialization
- Links from already important nodes
- Graph visualization
**Answer:** Links from already important nodes

**13) Why is a random graph generated in the later part of the code?**
- To replace real datasets
- To test scalability and behavior
- To guarantee convergence
- To reduce computation time
**Answer:** To test scalability and behavior

**14) Why does PageRank still work even if initial points are changed?**
- Because initial values are ignored
- Because points are normalized instantly
- Because sorting removes bias
- Because the algorithm converges to the same distribution
**Answer:** Because the algorithm converges to the same distribution

**15) Which statement best summarizes the PageRank idea demonstrated in the case study?**
- Popular nodes are those with many outgoing edges

- Every node eventually gets equal rank
- A node is important if important nodes point to it
**Answer:** A node is important if important nodes point to it
